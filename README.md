# Adobe-Reskill-Frontend-App

This project is divided into two main parts: the backend server and the frontend application. Follow the steps below to get the project up and running.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up the Backend Server

1. Navigate to the `server` folder:

    ```
    cd server
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    The backend server should now be running and listening for requests.

### 2. Setting Up the Frontend Application

1. Open a new terminal window/tab and navigate to the `reskill-frontend-app` folder:

    ```
    cd reskill-frontend-app
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend application:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend application should now be running and accessible in your web browser.

## Running the Project

To run the entire project, you need to have two terminal windows/tabs open:

- One terminal running the backend server (`npm run dev` in the `server` folder).
- Another terminal running the frontend application (`npm run dev` in the `reskill-frontend-app` folder).
